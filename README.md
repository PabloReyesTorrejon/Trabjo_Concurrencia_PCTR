# Parallel Solution of the One-Dimensional Wave Equation in Java

## Description
This project implements the discrete solution of the one-dimensional wave equation using concurrent programming in Java, employing the Fork/Join model. It includes both a sequential and a parallel version, with performance analysis and speedup curves. Additionally, it explores the use of ChatGPT as an assistance tool for code generation and technical documentation.

## Key Features:
- Implementation of the one-dimensional wave equation in its discrete version.
- Parallelization with Fork/Join to improve performance.
- Documentation generated with Javadoc.
- Results analysis with performance tests and speedup curves.

## Requirements:
- Java 8 or higher.
- GnuPlot for generating performance graphs.
